summary: 'Welcome to my little corner of the internet. ðŸ‘‹ This project started as a work portfolio and an excuse to become familiar with React, but soon evolved into a more personal space inspired by the internet culture I grew up with in the 2000s: that of MSN, Blogger, and later, Tumblr. These were the digital spaces where I pursued creative hobbies and connected with like-minded folks through fandoms. Itâ€™s also where my passion for digital experiences first sparked - by spending countless hours designing and building small Flash mini-games that I proudly shared on DeviantArt for my (few) followers. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed building it.'
