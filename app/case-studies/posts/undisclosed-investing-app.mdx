## Context

The client wanted to enter the retail investment app market with a dedicated product. Post-pandemic, the space observed significant growth, with increasing accessibility to financial markets and a surge in retail investor interest.

They challenged us to create an experience that would attract new investors and help them evolve their investing strategy from buying the casual individual stock into building a long-term, diversified portfolio.

## Business impact

Our market research insights led us to explore investing as a concept to attract and educate users toward portfolio diversification - bridging this product with Defianceâ€™s own ETF offering. 

In close collaboration with our client, we created a product that would reduce the barrier to entry for new investors and foster users with long-term objectives, aiming for a high customer lifetime value.

## Role and team

This project was developed within a cross-functional team of two designers (including myself), three frontend developers, a backend developer and a QA engineer. As the lead product designer, I was responsible for:

- Conducting market research
- Determining the product scope and features for the initial releases
- Creating proofs-of-concept and wireframes
- Collaborating with engineering on technical feasibility
- Researching and collaborating with third-party providers for integrations (e.g., know your customer and identity verification)
- Supporting the client in the development of a testing and launch plan

## The Process

### Research Phase

Add findings from market research

### Design Exploration

Based on the research, I created several design concepts focusing on:

1. **Clear fee structure** - Making exchange rates and fees transparent
2. **Simplified flow** - Reducing the number of steps to complete a payment
3. **Visual feedback** - Providing clear status updates throughout the process
4. **Compliance integration** - Seamlessly incorporating necessary compliance steps

## The Solution

The final design included:

- A redesigned payment dashboard with clear visibility of all currencies
- A streamlined payment flow reducing steps by 40%
- Real-time exchange rate information with fee transparency
- Integrated compliance checks that don't disrupt the user experience
- Responsive design that works across all devices

## Results

After implementing the redesigned payment UI:

- Payment completion rates increased by 28%
- Customer support inquiries related to payments decreased by 35%
- User satisfaction scores improved from 6.8 to 8.9 (out of 10)
- The system successfully scaled to support 15 new currencies

## Lessons Learned

This project reinforced the importance of:

- Starting with thorough user research
- Balancing regulatory requirements with usability
- Collaborating closely with engineering throughout the process
- Testing with real users at multiple stages

The redesigned payment UI played a key role in Navro's expansion to new markets and contributed to the company's growth from pre-seed to securing Series A investment.
