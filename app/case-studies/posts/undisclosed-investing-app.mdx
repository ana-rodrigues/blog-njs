## Context

The client, an issuer specialised in thematic and leveraged ETFs, wanted to enter the retail investment app market with a dedicated product. Post-pandemic, the space observed significant growth, with increasing accessibility to financial markets and a surge in retail investor interest.

They challenged us to create an experience that would attract new investors and help them evolve their investing strategy from buying the casual individual stock into building a long-term, diversified portfolio. 

## Business impact

In close collaboration with our client, we shaped a product that would reduce the barrier to entry for new investors and foster users with long-term objectives, aiming for a high customer lifetime value.

## Role and team

This project was developed within a cross-functional team of two designers (including myself), three frontend developers, a backend developer and a QA engineer. As the lead product designer, I was responsible for:

- Conducting market research
- Creating proofs-of-concept and wireframes
- Collaborating with engineering on technical feasibility
- Researching and collaborating with third-party providers for integrations (e.g., know your customer and identity verification)
- Partnering with the client in the validation of the initial scope and alpha launch plan

## Discovery

### Business opportunity

Post-pandemic, the retail investment app market observed significant growth, with a significant share coming through mobile apps, driven by improved accessibility and user experience, zero-comission management offers, ease of payment and the option to buy fractional shares. 

It is also worthwhile to note the growing popularity of thematic funds and ETFs during this bull market period, as - historically - new investing trends are often introduced during periods of high market performance. Funds and ETF's with a tech focus are particularly favoured during this period, as the global rush to digitise services unravels on the back of the Covid-19 pandemic.

### Known challenges

The opportunity to go to market with a new retail investment app was significant, but so were the challenges. The client was entering a competitive space - especially in the US - with players like Robinhood and Webull leading the way.

### Competitive landscape

We performed market research to identify how the different products addressed different investor profiles - from newcomers to seasoned investors. Our goal was to understand how we could shape an appealing user learning curve.

}

## Solution

Based on the research above, we created several design concepts focusing on:

1. Removing barriers to exploring the app
2. Creating engagement opportunities with stock themes
3. Simplified investing account application flow

### Removing barriers to exploring the app

We shaped opportunities for users to explore the app without an account, relying on the bare minimum information collected for perosnalisation purposes. So, instead of leading with the account creation journey, we focused on capturing user interests to personalise their discovery experience.

}

Pages like the stock detail view are rendered differently based on whether the user is authenticated or not.

- Without an account, users can only access a limited amount of data.
- With an account, users can access all historical stock performance information.

}


### Creating engagement opportunities with stock themes

Newcomers were highly motivated to start investing by soaring interest in specific industries, often discussed in online communities at Reddit, Twitter and other online forums. 

Our hypothesis was that nurturing this motivation would translate into a higher likelihood of completing the full onboarding process and remaining active for longer, so we aimed to increase signup intent by displaying thematic collections of stocks matching the user's interests. 

Themes are made available as ready-made baskets or portfolios, enabling investors to gain diversified exposure to a chosen theme with a single investment.

}

}

### Simplified verification flow

New users unnacostumed to the complex requirements of financial apps might be discouraged by a lengthy identity verification flow. We aimed to reduce the number of steps in the know-your-customer process as much as possible.
