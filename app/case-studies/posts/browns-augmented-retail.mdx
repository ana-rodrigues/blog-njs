## Context

Browns Fashion, part of the Farfetch group, opened their latest flagship boutique in early 2021. They faced a post-pandemic world, where the pressing need for digital transformation re-shaped the relationship between brands and their audiences. This posed particular challenges for luxury brands - especially with their most valuable segment - very important customers (VIC’s) - whose experience is deeply rooted in the boutique space and in their close relationship with sales associates.

In anticipation of the Mayfair boutique opening, we supported Browns and Farfetch in developing a state-of-the-art augmented retail experience, by pairing the consumer app with the store technological layer to help customers and sales associates building richer, long-lasting relationships.


## Business impact

This project contributed to:

- A reported uplift of incremental sales of around 30% after implementing the full experiment with augmented retail features
- Improved customer and sales associate experience, as a result of a more engaging and personalised in-store experience
- Increased conversion for products not available in the boutique via recommendations
- Farfetch's recognition as a global leader in luxury retail innovation.

## Role and team

The internal team behind this project included two frontend developers, a tech lead, a lead product designer (myself) and one QA engineer on the Gaspard+Bruno side. We collaborated closely with the Farfetch team, including the Browns' product and design teams.

In this context, I was responsible for:

- Conducting market research
- Creating proofs-of-concept and wireframes
- Collaborating with Gaspard+Brunos's engineering peers and Farfetch's innovation teams to determine technical feasibility
- Partnering with the Browns' product and design teams to validate experience design decisions

## Discovery

### Business opportunity

As COVID-19 pandemic restrictions eased, the industry recognised a valuable opportunity to bridge their digital and physical retail experiences:

### Known challenges

Whilst many retailers were developing their online experiences around convenience and volume, luxury brands had to navigate the high customer expectations of their audience, who not only expect premium products, but also the exclusivity and white glove service of the boutique experience.

### Competitive landscape

We analysed the competitive landscape to understand how other players were innovating across their e-commerce channels. Whilst most multibrand luxury retailers were betting on editorial curation and loyalty programmes in their online channels, single brands focused on the exclusivity of the physical boutique experience. 

Browns Fashion, with a strong physical footprint, had a unique opportunity to develop true omnichannel experiences, integrating their web and mobile channels with an augmented retail experience in the boutique space.

## Solution
Aiming to elevate the boutique experience, we implemented an omnichannel journey that bridged the online and offline experiences for a seamless transition between contexts. 

The final solution connects the consrumer app and the boutique technological layer to track and collect customer interactions in real-time: when a customer picked up or tried on an item, the action was captured and reflected in their profile. Data flowed seamlessly between touchpoints - the consumer app, the internal staff app, and the store technological layer.

<CustomImage src="/media/case-studies/browns-1.png" alt="Technological stack overview." />
}

Using this technological stack, we worked on the expansion of the consumer app functionality to:

1. Offer the customer the ability to curate and share wishlists with sales associates.
2. Augment the customer experience at the boutique when interacting with products on-display.
3. Create new product discovery journeys post-visit.

These features were developed in close relationship to the Browns Fashion product and design teams, who helped us loop the proposals through a cohort of sales associates for early feedback and validation.

}

### Wishlist curation and boutique availability

We brought in the ability to build and share wishlists with sales associates ahead of their boutique visit, who could then use this information to prepare a tailored shopping experience for the customer. 

Once the customer opened InStore mode in the consumer app, it would also inform them of their wishlist products' availability in the boutique, prompting interaction with the sales associate.

}

### Interacting with products on-display

When a customer picks up or tries on an item, the smart tags embedded in the product instantly communicate with the consumer app. This triggers a rich, interactive experience: customers can view detailed product information, explore styling suggestions, check availability in other sizes or colours.

}

### Post-visit product discovery

The data collected through smart tags during the boutique visit can be used to generate new product discovery journeys through recommendations and the "Seen In Store" feature. This data is also available to sales associates, who can use it to provide personalised recommendations to customers.

}

## Results

By embracing a true omnichannel approach, this project helped transform the act of discovering fashion into an immersive, memorable journey, setting Browns Fashion apart in the luxury retail landscape.

Equipped with the right technological layer, sales associates can provide a bespoke visit to customers, resulting in positive sales outcomes and reported customer satisfaction after the experiment. Browns' approach to augmented retail emphasises relationship-building, deep product knowledge, and delivering a memorable experience – hallmarks of true luxury.
