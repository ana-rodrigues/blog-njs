# Global Payment UI Redesign

## The Challenge

Navro needed a payment interface that could handle transactions across multiple currencies and payment methods while complying with regulatory requirements in different regions. The existing UI was built for a single market and couldn't scale to support the company's global expansion.

## My Role

As the lead product designer, I was responsible for:

- Conducting user research with existing clients
- Creating wireframes and prototypes
- Collaborating with engineering on technical feasibility
- Designing the final UI components
- Testing the interface with users

## The Process

### Research Phase

I began by interviewing 12 existing customers to understand their pain points with the current payment flow. Key findings included:

- Confusion about exchange rates and fees
- Uncertainty about payment status
- Difficulty navigating between different payment methods
- Concerns about security and compliance

### Design Exploration

Based on the research, I created several design concepts focusing on:

1. **Clear fee structure** - Making exchange rates and fees transparent
2. **Simplified flow** - Reducing the number of steps to complete a payment
3. **Visual feedback** - Providing clear status updates throughout the process
4. **Compliance integration** - Seamlessly incorporating necessary compliance steps

### Prototyping and Testing

I developed interactive prototypes in Figma and conducted usability testing with both existing clients and potential new users. This iterative process helped refine the design and identify edge cases we hadn't considered.

## The Solution

The final design included:

- A redesigned payment dashboard with clear visibility of all currencies
- A streamlined payment flow reducing steps by 40%
- Real-time exchange rate information with fee transparency
- Integrated compliance checks that don't disrupt the user experience
- Responsive design that works across all devices

## Results

After implementing the redesigned payment UI:

- Payment completion rates increased by 28%
- Customer support inquiries related to payments decreased by 35%
- User satisfaction scores improved from 6.8 to 8.9 (out of 10)
- The system successfully scaled to support 15 new currencies

## Lessons Learned

This project reinforced the importance of:

- Starting with thorough user research
- Balancing regulatory requirements with usability
- Collaborating closely with engineering throughout the process
- Testing with real users at multiple stages

The redesigned payment UI played a key role in Navro's expansion to new markets and contributed to the company's growth from pre-seed to securing Series A investment.
